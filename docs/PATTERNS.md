In 2019, MongoDB released an article talking about some patterns that you should use to model you database. This article was called [Building with Patterns: A Summary](https://www.mongodb.com/blog/post/building-with-patterns-a-summary).

In this article they have shown the power of patterns, how each of them could be used, the advantages and disadvantages as well as some use cases.
